# Norma Medicare Advantage GTM Playbook

## Executive Summary

Medicare Advantage represents Norma's **largest scale opportunity** with 34.1 million enrollees (54% of Medicare beneficiaries). MA plans compete heavily on supplemental benefits, and social isolation/loneliness directly impacts the costs plans bear under capitated payments. However, the annual bid cycle (June deadline) and long sales cycles require strategic timing and patience.

**Why Medicare Advantage:**
- 34.1M enrollees, $462B+ in annual spending
- Plans compete on supplemental benefits to attract/retain members
- Social isolation costs MA plans $1,608/member/year in excess utilization
- Capitated model = plans directly benefit from engagement interventions
- SSBCI pathway enables targeting to chronically ill populations

**Key Constraint:** June bid submission deadline means partnerships must be secured 6-9 months in advance to be included in next year's benefits.

## 1. Market Overview

### Medicare Advantage Enrollment Growth

| Year | MA Enrollment | % of Medicare | Growth |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| 2007 | ~8M | 19% | — |
| 2020 | 24M | 39% | — |
| 2024 | 32.8M | 51% | 7% |
| 2025 | 34.1M | 54% | 4% |

### Market Share by Insurer (2025)

| Insurer | Enrollment | Market Share | YoY Change |
|---------|------------|--------------|------------|
| **UnitedHealthcare** | 9.9M | 29% | +505K |
| **Humana** | 5.8M | 17% | -297K |
| **CVS/Aetna** | 4.1M | 12% | +growth |
| **Elevance (Anthem)** | 2.4M | 7% | +249K |
| **Kaiser** | 2.0M | 6% | stable |
| **Others** | 9.9M | 29% | varies |

**Key Insight:** UnitedHealthcare, CVS/Aetna, and Elevance captured 60%+ of all new enrollment in 2024-2025. Humana lost members.

### Supplemental Benefits Landscape

MA plans use supplemental benefits to differentiate and attract members. Common benefits include:

| Benefit Type | 2024 Plans Offering | 2025 Plans Offering | Trend |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Fitness (SilverSneakers, etc.) | 95%+ | 95%+ | Stable |
| Over-the-counter allowance | 85% | 73% | Declining |
| Remote access technology | 74% | 53% | **Declining** |
| Meal benefits | 72% | 65% | Declining |
| Transportation | 36% | 30% | Declining |
| Dental | High | Declining | Reduced allowances |

**Key Insight:** Supplemental benefits are being cut due to margin pressure from CMS rate changes. This creates opportunity for **high-ROI benefits** that demonstrably reduce costs (like loneliness intervention).

### Social Isolation Economics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Isolated seniors' excess healthcare costs | $1,608/year | AARP/Harvard |
| Medicare spending attributable to isolation | $6.7B/year | AARP |
| Mortality risk increase from isolation | 26% | National Academies |
| Dementia risk increase from loneliness | 50% | Journal of Neurology |

**Norma's Value Prop:** If Norma reduces isolation-driven utilization by even 20%, that's $320/member/year in savings—far exceeding any reasonable PMPM cost.

## 4. Supplemental Benefit Pathways

### Pathway 1: Standard Supplemental Benefit

**What it is:** Norma offered as optional benefit to all plan members

**Requirements:**
- Must be "primarily health related"
- CMS reviews for discrimination (can't target only healthy members)
- Included in plan bid

**Pros:** Broad availability, simple structure
**Cons:** Plans may limit to differentiate tiers

---

### Pathway 2: SSBCI (Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill)

**What it is:** Benefits targeted to members with specific chronic conditions

**Requirements (CMS 2026 Final Rule):**
- Must demonstrate "reasonable expectation of improving health or overall function"
- Plans must maintain bibliography of supporting research
- Targeted to chronically ill enrollees

**Relevant Conditions for Norma:**
- Depression/mental health conditions
- Heart failure (social support improves outcomes)
- Diabetes (engagement improves adherence)
- COPD (reduces anxiety, improves self-management)
- Dementia/cognitive impairment (stimulation, safety)

**Pros:** Can target highest-need/highest-cost members, stronger ROI case
**Cons:** Narrower population, research documentation required

**Recommendation:** Position Norma for SSBCI pathway—higher impact population, clearer ROI.

---

### Pathway 3: Value-Based Insurance Design (VBID) Model

**What it is:** CMS model allowing MA plans to test benefit innovations

**2024 Stats:** 12.4M enrollees in VBID plans, 8.7M offered additional supplemental benefits

**Opportunity:** Partner with plan already in VBID model for innovation flexibility

---

### Pathway 4: Pilot Outside Formal Benefits

**What it is:** Plan funds Norma deployment as care management initiative, not formal benefit

**Pros:** No bid cycle constraint, can start immediately
**Cons:** Limited scale, may not reach all members

**Recommendation:** Use this pathway for initial proof points, then convert to formal benefit.

---

## 5. Decision-Maker Mapping

### Key Roles at MA Plans

| Role | Responsibilities | Norma Pitch Focus |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Chief Medicare Officer** | Overall MA strategy, P&L | ROI, competitive differentiation |
| **VP Medicare Products** | Benefit design, bid submission | CMS pathway, member appeal |
| **Chief Medical Officer** | Clinical programs, quality | Outcomes, Star ratings impact |
| **VP Innovation** | New technologies, pilots | Technology integration, AI |
| **Chief Growth Officer** | Member acquisition/retention | Differentiation, member experience |
| **VP Care Management** | Population health programs | Care team integration |

### Decision Process

1. **Innovation/Product team** evaluates fit and feasibility
2. **Clinical team** reviews outcomes evidence
3. **Finance team** models ROI and bid impact
4. **Legal/Compliance** reviews CMS requirements
5. **Executive committee** approves for bid inclusion
6. **CMS** reviews bid (no separate approval for supplemental benefits)

**Timeline:** 6-12 months from first meeting to bid inclusion

---

## 6. Sales Messaging & Talking Points

### Opening Pitch

> "Medicare Advantage plans are cutting supplemental benefits due to margin pressure—but social isolation is costing you $1,608 per member per year in excess utilization. Norma is an AI companion that directly addresses loneliness, with demonstrated 95% reduction in comparable deployments. Unlike fitness benefits or OTC cards, this isn't a nice-to-have—it's a cost-reduction intervention disguised as a member benefit."

### Value Proposition by Stakeholder

**For Chief Medicare Officers:**
- ROI: $15-25 PMPM cost vs. $320+/member/year savings potential
- Differentiation in competitive markets
- Member retention (engaged members stay)
- Star rating impact (member experience)

**For VP Medicare Products:**
- SSBCI-ready with research documentation
- Flexible deployment (all members or targeted)
- Simple member experience
- No hardware/logistics complexity

**For Chief Medical Officers:**
- Loneliness intervention is clinical intervention
- Medication adherence support
- Early warning detection
- Cognitive stimulation for dementia prevention

**For VP Innovation:**
- AI capability without building internally
- Proven senior engagement (voice-first)
- Fast deployment (weeks, not months)
- Data integration with care management systems

### ROI Model

**Assumptions:**
- MA plan with 500,000 members
- 30% have significant social isolation
- Isolated members cost $1,608/year more
- Norma deployed to isolated population (150,000)
- 20% reduction in isolation-driven costs

**Calculation:**
- Baseline excess cost: 150,000 × $1,608 = $241M
- With Norma (20% reduction): $241M × 20% = **$48M savings**
- Norma cost: 150,000 × $20 PMPM × 12 = $36M
- **Net savings: $12M/year (33% ROI)**

*Conservative estimate—other studies show higher isolation cost and greater intervention impact.*

### Key Statistics

| Stat | Source |
|------|--------|
| 54% of Medicare beneficiaries now in MA | KFF 2025 |
| Social isolation costs MA $1,608/member/year | AARP/Harvard |
| ElliQ reduced loneliness by 95% | Intuition Robotics |
| Remote tech benefits dropped from 74% to 53% | KFF |
| Humana lost 297K members in 2024-2025 | KFF |

### Objection Handling

**"We're cutting supplemental benefits, not adding them."**
> "You're cutting benefits that don't impact costs. Loneliness intervention directly reduces utilization—this is cost reduction, not just a member perk. At $15-25 PMPM with documented savings of $320+/member, the ROI is clear."

**"Our members won't use technology."**
> "That's exactly why voice-first design matters. Norma requires no app, no screen, no tech skills. NY State deployed ElliQ to seniors averaging 80+ years old with 95% loneliness reduction. Our design is even simpler."

**"We missed the bid cycle for next year."**
> "Let's pilot outside the formal benefit structure this year—fund it through care management or innovation budget. We'll generate the outcomes data you need to include it in next year's bid with confidence."

**"How does this affect our Star ratings?"**
> "Member experience surveys directly impact Star ratings. Engaged, less lonely members rate their plan higher. We can also support HEDIS measures around care coordination and follow-up."

**"What's the CMS pathway?"**
> "Standard supplemental benefit for broad deployment, or SSBCI for targeted deployment to chronically ill members. We have research documentation ready for SSBCI review. No separate CMS approval needed—it's part of your normal bid."

## 10. Outreach Templates

### Email to Devoted Health

**Subject:** AI companion for Devoted members — fellow healthcare innovator

To the Devoted Health team,

Congratulations on the U.S. News recognition as a Best Medicare Advantage Company. Building a member-first MA plan is exactly what seniors deserve.

I'm building Norma, an AI companion designed specifically for Medicare beneficiaries. We address a problem that costs MA plans $1,608/member/year: social isolation.

For Devoted specifically, I see three opportunities:

1. **Member differentiation** — First MA plan with AI companionship as a benefit
2. **Cost reduction** — Loneliness intervention reduces ER visits, hospitalizations
3. **Experience scores** — Engaged members rate their plans higher

Our deployment is voice-first (no app, no screen)—designed for the seniors who need it most. NY State's comparable deployment showed 95% loneliness reduction.

As you expand to 29 states, could AI companionship be the differentiator? Worth a conversation?

### Email to Alignment Healthcare

**Subject:** AI for Alignment's 210K members

John [Kao],

Congrats on 35% growth and the path to 231K members. That kind of growth in a margin-pressured market is impressive.

I noticed Alignment built its own technology platform (AVA) for care management. I'm building the patient-facing complement: an AI companion that engages members daily and feeds insights back to your care teams.

Social isolation costs MA plans $1,608/member/year in excess utilization. For Alignment's California and Texas markets—with large senior populations—addressing loneliness could meaningfully impact your medical cost ratio.

Given Alignment's technology DNA, I think you'd find our approach interesting. Would you have time for a call?

### Email to Humana

**Subject:** Member engagement after a challenging year

To the Humana Medicare team,

I noticed Humana lost ~300K MA members this past year while UnitedHealthcare and Elevance gained. In a market where differentiation matters more than ever, I wanted to share an idea.

Norma is an AI companion that addresses social isolation—a problem costing MA plans $1,608/member/year. With CenterWell's focus on home-based care, there's a natural integration: AI companionship between home health visits.

For Humana specifically:
- Member retention through daily engagement
- CenterWell integration for care coordination
- Differentiation in competitive markets

Would the Medicare innovation team have time to explore this?
