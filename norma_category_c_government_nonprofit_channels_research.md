# Norma Business Strategy Research
## Category C: Government & Nonprofit Channels

**Research Date:** January 2025 (Updated with Latest Web Research)
**Focus:** Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) and AARP Partnership Opportunities
**Status:** Comprehensive Research Complete

---

## Executive Summary

The government and nonprofit channel represents a significant strategic opportunity for Norma, an AI companion startup for US seniors. This research identifies two primary pathways:

1. **Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs):** A nationwide network of 622+ agencies that serve as the backbone of community-based senior services, with combined annual federal funding of ~$2.4 billion. Recent pilot programs (notably NYSOFA's ElliQ deployment) demonstrate strong government appetite for AI companion technology, with 95% of participants reporting reduced loneliness.

2. **AARP Partnership:** With 38 million members and $1.8+ billion in annual revenue, AARP represents the single largest aggregation of the 50+ demographic. The AgeTech Collaborative provides a clear entry pathway for startups, with AARP investing in ~83 companies and reaching 2+ million older adults through portfolio companies.

**Key Opportunity Sizing:**
- AAA Network: ~622 agencies serving millions of seniors; potential for state-level pilots followed by broader rollout
- AARP: 38 million members; technology endorsement partnerships generate 4-5% royalty on revenue
- Combined addressable market: $43.8 billion senior care technology market by 2030

**Recommended Priority:** Begin with AARP AgeTech Collaborative application (faster timeline, validation benefit) while simultaneously pursuing 2-3 state-level AAA pilots (California, New York, Texas).

### Critical New Findings (January 2025 Update)

1. **2024 OAA Final Rule Mandate:** The 2024 Older Americans Act Final Rule explicitly requires AAAs to "become knowledgeable and support innovative solutions and technologies such as telehealth services, smart home devices, and other assistive technologies." This regulatory change creates new procurement opportunities for technology vendors.

2. **ElliQ Expansion Success:** Multiple new AAA partnerships announced:
   - California AAA Area 4 (Sacramento/Placer Counties)
   - Broward County FL (AAABC)
   - Olympic Area Agency on Aging (Washington)
   - Wisconsin ADRC of Dunn County (Inclusa Foundation grant)

3. **GetSetUp AAA Partnerships:** GetSetUp has partnered with government agencies in 26+ states, demonstrating AAA appetite for technology solutions. New York alone saw 122,000 learners take 169,000 classes in the first year.

4. **AARP Leadership Transition:** Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan named as incoming CEO (announced November 2024), replacing Jo Ann Jenkins. This transition may create new strategic opportunities.

5. **Caregiver Market Expansion:** AARP's 2025 Caregiving Report shows 63 million Americans now serve as caregivers (50% increase since 2015), with 55% using digital tools for care coordination and 47% interested in technology assistance.

| Source | Percentage | Amount |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Royalties | 61% | $1.134 billion |
| Membership Dues | ~17% | ~$315 million |
| Other (advertising, grants, etc.) | ~22% | ~$400 million |

**Corporate Structure:**
```
AARP (501(c)(4) nonprofit)
    ├── AARP Services, Inc. (for-profit subsidiary)
    │       └── Manages member benefits partnerships
    │       └── Insurance product relationships
    │       └── Technology partnerships
    │
    ├── AARP Financial (for-profit subsidiary)
    │       └── Financial products
    │
    └── AARP Foundation (501(c)(3) charitable arm)
            └── Programs for vulnerable older adults

## Part 5: Recommended Approach

### 5.1 Prioritization Framework

| Channel | Timeline to Revenue | Investment Required | Risk Level | Strategic Value |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|-----------------|
| AARP AgeTech | 6-12 months | Low-Medium | Medium | High (validation) |
| State AAA Pilots | 12-18 months | Medium | Medium-High | High (outcome data) |
| National AAA | 24-36 months | High | High | Very High (scale) |
| AARP Endorsement | 24-36 months | Medium | Medium | Very High (reach) |

### 5.2 Recommended Priority Order

**Immediate (Months 1-3):**
1. Apply to AARP AgeTech Collaborative pitch event
2. Register for USAging Conference (July 2025)
3. Research target state AAA leadership

**Short-Term (Months 4-12):**
1. Complete AARP Accelerator program
2. Exhibit at USAging Conference
3. Initiate conversations with 3-5 AAA directors
4. Secure AARP investment (if available)

**Medium-Term (Months 12-24):**
1. Launch 2-3 state AAA pilots
2. Collect and publish outcome data
3. Work with AARP portfolio manager on growth
4. Present results at aging industry conferences

**Long-Term (Months 24-36):**
1. Negotiate state-level AAA contracts
2. Pursue AARP member benefit endorsement
3. Scale nationally through both channels

### 5.3 Resource Requirements

**Team:**
- Business Development lead (government/nonprofit experience)
- Customer Success manager (pilot support)
- Policy/regulatory advisor (part-time/consultant)

**Budget:**
- USAging Conference: ~$5,000-15,000 (exhibit + travel)
- AARP Pitch Events: Minimal (virtual participation)
- Pilot Support: $50,000-100,000 per pilot
- Legal/Contracts: $25,000-50,000

**Timeline Investment:**
- 6+ months to first revenue (AARP path)
- 12+ months to first revenue (AAA path)

## Part 6: Risks and Considerations

### 6.1 AAA Channel Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Funding Uncertainty** | High | FY2025/26 budgets under pressure; target innovation-specific funds |
| **Procurement Complexity** | High | Long RFP cycles (3-4 years); position for next cycle |
| **Bureaucratic Decision-Making** | High | Build relationships early; secure internal champions |
| **State-by-State Variation** | Medium | Focus on progressive states first |
| **Outcome Measurement Requirements** | Medium | Build robust data collection from day one |
| **Competition from Established Players** | Medium | ElliQ has head start; differentiate on price/features |

**Funding-Specific Concerns:**
- OAA funding $392 million below authorized levels
- Some AAAs experiencing 40%+ funding cuts
- Reauthorization overdue, creating uncertainty
- Baby Boomer surge will strain resources further

### 6.2 AARP Channel Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **High Bar for Partnership** | High | Demonstrate clear member value and quality |
| **Long Decision Cycles** | High | Start with Collaborative, build relationship over time |
| **Exclusivity Requirements** | Medium | Understand terms before committing |
| **Brand Association Risk (for AARP)** | Medium | Ensure robust data privacy and security |
| **Revenue Share Impact on Unit Economics** | Medium | Model scenarios with 4-5% royalty |
| **Competition from Portfolio Companies** | Medium | Differentiate clearly; find unserved niche |

**AARP-Specific Considerations:**
- AARP's reliance on royalties creates strong incentive for profitable partnerships
- 2011 Congressional scrutiny of business model (may face again)
- New CEO (Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan) may shift priorities

### 6.3 Market-Wide Risks

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Regulatory Changes** | Healthcare regulations, data privacy | Maintain compliance; monitor policy |
| **Technology Adoption Barriers** | 64% of 50+ say tech not designed for them | Prioritize accessibility in design |
| **Competition** | ElliQ, GrandPad, emerging players | Differentiate on companionship/AI |
| **Economic Downturn** | Could impact discretionary spending | Position as health necessity, not luxury |
| **AI Backlash** | Privacy concerns, depersonalization fears | Emphasize human connection enhancement |
