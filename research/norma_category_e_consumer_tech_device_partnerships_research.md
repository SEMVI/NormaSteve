# Norma Business Strategy Research: Category E - Consumer Tech & Device Partnerships

**Research Date:** January 2026
**Focus:** Senior Cell Phone Providers, Medical Alert (PERS) Companies, Senior AI Agent Product Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

The consumer tech and device partnership landscape for senior-focused AI companions represents a **$15-20 billion addressable market** across three interconnected segments: senior cell phones ($5-8B), medical alert/PERS systems ($2.5B US / $10B global), and companion technology ($200M-3B depending on definition). This research identifies significant partnership opportunities for Norma to accelerate market penetration through pre-installation deals, hardware bundles, and channel partnerships.

### Key Findings

1. **Senior Cell Phone Providers** offer the most immediate partnership opportunity with 5+ million combined subscribers across Lively (1M+), Consumer Cellular (4M+), and T-Mobile 55+ (millions). Pre-installation partnerships could provide instant scale.

2. **Medical Alert/PERS Companies** are actively seeking differentiation beyond emergency response. The Medical Guardian acquisition of MobileHelp (600K+ combined members) and industry consolidation creates partnership windows for AI companionship features.

3. **The Competitive Landscape** is nascent but evolving rapidly. ElliQ leads with "thousands" of users through government partnerships, but Amazon has exited (Alexa Together discontinued June 2024), leaving a significant market gap.

4. **Recommended Priority:** Partner first with Consumer Cellular/GrandPad (immediate scale + AARP relationship), then pursue PERS integration deals, while positioning against ElliQ's government-focused strategy with a direct-to-consumer + healthcare payer model.

### Market Opportunity Sizing

| Segment | US Market Size (2024) | Growth Rate | Key Players | Partnership Potential |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Senior Cell Phones | $5-8 Billion | 8-10% CAGR | Lively, Consumer Cellular, T-Mobile | HIGH - Pre-install deals |

### Industry Evolution: From Emergency Response to Daily Engagement

The PERS industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation:

**Traditional PERS (1970s-2010s):**
- Landline-based "I've fallen and I can't get up" model
- Emergency-only use case
- High monthly fees, low engagement
- ~1 button press per year average

**Modern PERS (2020s+):**
- Mobile, GPS-enabled devices
- Fall detection, activity monitoring
- Health tracking integration
- Moving toward daily engagement

**This creates a strategic opening for AI companionship integration.**

### Major Players Deep-Dive

- **Key Acquisitions:** Philips Lifeline (2021), Tunstall Americas (2019)
- **Backing:** Rockbridge Growth Equity

**Historical Context:**
Philips Lifeline held 32.6% market share in 2018 with 720,000 subscribers, but lost share to competitors. The CareSage predictive analytics platform (developed on 600,000+ subscriber data) remains a key asset.

**Key Insight:** The narrow "senior AI companion" category is small, but Norma's TAM should include the broader categories of:
- Senior loneliness/isolation solutions
- Medication management
- Caregiver coordination
- Telehealth engagement

### Competitive Landscape Analysis

#### 1. ElliQ (Intuition Robotics) - Primary Competitor

**Company Profile:**
- **Founded:** 2015, Tel Aviv, Israel
- **Total Funding:** $83-88 million
- **Key Investors:** Toyota Ventures, Woven Capital, Samsung NEXT, OurCrowd

- **Employees:** 51-200

**Product:**
- Hardware robot with screen + lamp-style companion
- Proactive engagement (initiates conversations)
- Uses proprietary "Relationship Orchestrator" technology
- Launched commercially March 2022

**Pricing:**
- Setup: $249.99 one-time
- Subscription: $29.99-$59.99/month
- Often provided free through government partnerships

**User Metrics:**
- "Thousands" of active users
- Average engagement: 30+ interactions/day, 6 days/week
- 90-95% reduction in self-reported loneliness
- 94% boost in key mental health metrics

**Key Partnerships:**
- New York State Office for the Aging (800+ devices deployed)
- Inclusa (Humana company)
- Multiple Area Agencies on Aging
- Uber Health, Bold, Mayo Clinic integrations

**Recent Developments:**
- **CES 2024:** Launched ElliQ 3 with enhanced generative AI
- **September 2024:** Kanematsu partnership for Japanese market

**Strategic Analysis:**
ElliQ has pursued a **government-first B2G strategy**, focusing on Area Agencies on Aging rather than direct-to-consumer or healthcare payers. This creates opportunity for Norma to pursue alternative channels.

**Weaknesses:**
- Hardware-dependent (higher cost, deployment friction)
- Government sales cycle is slow
- Limited direct-to-consumer presence
- $250+ upfront cost barrier

#### 2. Amazon Alexa Together - DISCONTINUED

**Key Finding:** Amazon discontinued Alexa Together in **June 2024**.

**What It Offered:**
- $19.99/month subscription
- 24/7 emergency helpline
- Activity monitoring for caregivers
- Fall detection (via third-party devices)
- Remote assist for caregivers
- Circle of Support (up to 10 caregivers)

**Why It Failed:**
- Generic voice assistant not optimized for seniors
- Lacked proactive engagement
- Required third-party devices for key features
- No emotional companionship component

**Implication for Norma:** Amazon's exit validates that generic voice assistants are insufficient for senior care. Purpose-built AI companions have competitive moat.

#### 3. Google Nest Hub

**Current Senior Features:**
- Sleep Sensing (radar-based, contactless)
- Fitbit Premium integration (sleep tracking)
- Fall detection: **Patent filed but not deployed**

**Strategic Position:**
Google has not made a significant push into senior-specific features. Fall detection remains in patent stage. No companion/loneliness features.

**Implication for Norma:** Google is not a direct competitor currently; potential technology partner for hardware.

#### 4. GrandPad (Tablet + AI)

**Company Profile:**
- Purpose-built tablet for 75+ seniors
- **Users:** 1.4 million connected (seniors + family)
- **Partners:** AT&T, Orange Belgium, Consumer Cellular
- **Pricing:** $299 + $40/month

**Recent Developments:**
- **CES 2025:** Launched "Grandie Chat" - AI voice feature using OpenAI models
- Seniors adopting generative AI at 3x rate of age peers
