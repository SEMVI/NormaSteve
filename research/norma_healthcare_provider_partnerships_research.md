   - Established vendor ecosystem ready for AI integration
   - 80,000+ physicians enrolled in new CCM programs in 2024 alone

2. **Home Health Agencies** represent a massive, consolidating market with:
   - $141 million annual savings demonstrated in HHVBP model
   - 95%+ of patient time without professional support (critical gap)
   - Payment adjustments of +/-5% tied to readmission reduction
   - 130,000+ caregiver workforce shortage creating technology demand

3. **Senior Outpatient Services** offer high patient volumes with documented challenges:
   - 7-32% missed dialysis treatment rate
   - 24-50% cardiac rehabilitation dropout rate

### 4.6 How Norma Could Serve as Patient Engagement Layer

**Core Value Proposition:** Norma addresses the #1 documented barrier (patient engagement at 38%) while CCM platforms handle backend billing, documentation, and care coordination.

**Integration Architecture:**

| Function | Norma's Role | CCM Platform's Role |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Patient Contact** | AI-powered daily/weekly check-ins | Log time, generate documentation |
| **Symptom Monitoring** | Natural conversation about health | Trigger alerts to care team |
| **Medication Adherence** | Reminders, encouragement | Track compliance data |
| **Care Plan Education** | Explain in simple terms | Maintain care plan |
| **Emotional Support** | Companionship, reduce isolation | Report mood/engagement metrics |
| **Appointment Reminders** | Conversational prompts | Schedule coordination |
| **Time Documentation** | Timestamped interaction logs | Billing support |

### 4.7 Revenue Model Opportunities

**Model 1: Technology Licensing to CCM Vendors**
- License Norma to ChartSpan, HealthSnap, etc. as patient engagement module
- Per-patient-per-month fee: $5-15 PMPM
- White-label opportunity
- Target: CCM vendors seeking differentiation

**Model 2: CCM Enablement for Practices**
- Partner with physician practices to enable CCM billing
- Norma provides the 20+ minutes of patient contact required
- Practice captures Medicare reimbursement; Norma takes percentage
- Revenue share: 30-40% of CCM revenue

**Model 3: Full-Service CCM Partner**
- Norma becomes CCM service provider
- Compete with ChartSpan, Chronic Care IQ
- Higher revenue per patient (~$40-60/month) but higher operational complexity

**Model 4: Payer Partnership**
- Contract with Medicare Advantage plans
- Supplement their CCM programs with AI engagement
- Population-level deployment

**Revenue Comparison:**

| Model | Revenue/Patient/Month | Complexity | Scalability |
|-------|----------------------|------------|-------------|
| Technology Licensing | $5-15 | Low | Very High |
| Enablement Fee | $15-30 | Medium | High |
| Revenue Share (30%) | $18-25 | Medium | High |
| Full-Service | $40-60 | High | Medium |

- Update advance directives

### 5.2 Utilization Rates & Underutilization

**AWV Utilization Trend:**

| Year | AWV Rate | Note |
|------|----------|------|
| 2011 | 7% | First year of program |
| 2014 | 16% | Slow growth |
| 2018 | 31.6% | Moderate improvement |
| 2020 | 45% | MCBS data |
| Current | ~45-50% | **Still 50%+ of eligible seniors NOT receiving AWV** |

**Documented Disparities:**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Highest acuity patients | 11.3 percentage points lower |
| Rural counties | 3.8 percentage points lower |
| Non-White beneficiaries | Lower rates |
| Lower income/education | Lower usage |
| Older-old (75+) | Lower than younger seniors |

**Key Research Finding:** "Monthly rates of annual wellness visits for Medicare patients increased sixfold when a health system folded them into problem-based office appointments" (Ann Fam Med 2025)

### 5.3 Clinic Challenges in Outreach

**Outreach Difficulties:**
- Identifying eligible patients in EHR
- Reaching patients effectively (phone, mail, portal)
- Explaining value of preventive services vs. physical exam
- Converting outreach to scheduled appointments

**Resource Constraints:**
- Staff time for manual phone outreach limited
- Front desk overwhelmed with scheduling
- Clinical staff focused on acute care
- No dedicated preventive care outreach staff

**Patient-Level Barriers:**
- Lack of awareness AWV is free
- Confusion between AWV and annual physical
- Patients who had recent physical dismiss AWV value
- Transportation challenges (especially rural)

### 5.4 HIPAA Compliance for AI Outreach
