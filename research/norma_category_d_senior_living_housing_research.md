# Executive Summary

The senior living and housing sector represents a **$907+ billion market** with compelling structural tailwinds for an AI companion like Norma. Three distinct channels offer differentiated go-to-market opportunities:

1. **Retirement Communities (Senior Living Operators)** - The largest and most scalable B2B opportunity, with 53,000+ communities serving millions of residents.

3. **Aging-in-Place Renovation Companies** - A $20-25 billion and rapidly growing market where home modifications create a natural bundling opportunity with smart home technology and AI companions. CAPS-certified professionals represent a targeted partner channel.

**Prioritization Recommendation:**
1. **First Priority:** Retirement Communities (highest scale, clearest ROI, established B2B buying patterns)
2. **Second Priority:** Village Movement (mission alignment, grassroots advocacy, low-cost market validation)
3. **Third Priority:** Aging-in-Place Renovation (bundle opportunity requires partnership development)
