# Norma Go-To-Market Playbook
## Employer Caregiver Benefits Market

**Date:** January 2026
**Prepared for:** Norma AI Companion
**Target Market:** B2B2C Employer Caregiver Benefits

---

## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| US Family Caregivers | 63 million (45% increase since 2015) |
| Working Caregivers | 70% of all caregivers are employed |
| Annual Employer Productivity Loss | $17-33 billion |
| Employers Offering Caregiver Benefits | Only 13% |
| ROI on Caregiver Benefits | Up to 425% (average 366%) |
| Cost Per Caregiver (absenteeism) | $2,110-5,251/year |

### Strategic Positioning

Norma fills a critical gap in the employer caregiver benefits ecosystem: **daily companion engagement and remote monitoring** for employees' aging parents. While platforms like Wellthy and Cariloop provide care coordination and navigation, none offer an AI-powered companion that provides:

1. **Daily touchpoints** with aging parents (reducing worry for working caregivers)
2. **Remote visibility** into parent wellness (cognitive engagement, mood, activity)
3. **Scalable companionship** (what human care coordinators cannot deliver at scale)
4. **Proactive alerts** for caregivers when patterns change

---

## Part 3: Sales Messaging & Talking Points

### 3.1 Opening Pitch

**The Hook (Data-Driven):**

> "Caregiver benefits deliver 366% ROI, yet only 13% of employers offer them. Meanwhile, 63 million Americans are caregivers, and working caregivers cost their employers $17-33 billion annually in lost productivity. The gap between the opportunity and adoption represents one of the largest untapped areas in employee benefits."

**The Problem:**

> "Your employees are worried about their aging parents. They're missing work, losing focus, and burning out. Existing caregiver benefits help with care coordination, but there's a missing piece: daily engagement with their parents. Employees can't be there every day, and care coordinators can't provide the daily companionship and wellness monitoring that brings peace of mind."

**The Solution:**

> "Norma is an AI companion for seniors that provides daily engagement and gives working caregivers visibility into their parent's wellbeing. It's the remote presence your employees wish they could have with their aging parents."

---

### 3.2 Value Proposition by Audience

**For Benefit Platform Partners:**

| Value | Message |
|-------|---------|
| **Gap Filler** | "Norma extends your platform's value by providing what human care coordinators cannot: daily companion engagement with the care recipient" |
| **Differentiation** | "Be the first caregiver benefit platform to offer AI companion technology for seniors" |
| **Revenue Opportunity** | "Add a premium tier or module without building technology from scratch" |
| **Engagement** | "Increase platform engagement with daily touchpoints to employees via parent wellness updates" |

**For HR/Benefits Leaders (Direct Sales):**

| Value | Message |
|-------|---------|
| **Reduced Absenteeism** | "Working caregivers miss 6.6 days/year. Daily visibility into parent wellness reduces anxiety and unplanned absences" |
| **Increased Retention** | "Nearly 1/3 of caregivers have left a job for caregiving. Norma provides peace of mind that helps them stay" |
| **Employee Satisfaction** | "83% of caregiving employees say it affects their performance. Norma reduces their cognitive load" |
| **Differentiation** | "Offer a benefit competitors don't have - be recognized as a caregiver-friendly employer" |

**For Brokers/Consultants:**

| Value | Message |
|-------|---------|
| **New Category** | "AI companions for seniors is a $5.6B market by 2030 - help your clients be early adopters" |
| **Client Differentiation** | "Help your clients stand out in the war for talent with innovative benefits" |
| **Proven Category** | "ElliQ shows 95% loneliness reduction. Norma brings this to the employer market" |

---

### 3.3 Objection Handling

**Objection: "Privacy concerns about AI monitoring seniors"**

> **Response:** "Privacy is our top priority. Norma is designed as a companion first - conversations are private. Caregivers receive wellness summaries (engagement levels, mood trends) not conversation transcripts. Seniors control what's shared, and we're fully compliant with data privacy regulations. This is about peace of mind, not surveillance."

**Objection: "Will seniors actually use it?"**

> **Response:** "ElliQ, an AI companion for seniors, reports 30+ daily interactions per user and 95% say they feel less lonely. The key is designing for seniors from the start - voice-first, simple, personalized. Plus, the caregiver (your employee) is motivated to help their parent get started. We provide onboarding support."

**Objection: "What about employees without aging parents?"**

> **Response:** "73% of employees have some caregiving responsibility. This includes aging parents, spouses with chronic conditions, and grandparents. And it's not about current caregivers only - it's about future caregivers. The average caregiver journey is 4+ years. Employees value knowing the benefit exists when they need it."

**Objection: "We already have a caregiver benefit (Wellthy/Cariloop)"**

> **Response:** "That's great - you're ahead of the 87% of employers who don't. Norma complements care coordination platforms by providing what they can't: daily engagement with the care recipient. We integrate with platforms like Wellthy and Cariloop to enhance their offering, not replace it."

**Objection: "How do we measure ROI?"**

> **Response:** "Three ways: (1) Employee surveys on caregiving stress and work impact, (2) Utilization and engagement metrics (how often caregivers check in, how engaged their parents are), (3) HR metrics like absenteeism and turnover among caregiving employees. We provide a dashboard and quarterly business reviews."

**Objection: "The cost seems high"**

> **Response:** "At $4-8 PEPM, Norma costs less than one day of unplanned absence. Caregivers miss an average of 6.6 days per year - if Norma prevents even one absence, it's paid for itself. Studies show caregiver benefits deliver 2-4x ROI through retention alone."

---

### 3.4 ROI Calculator Framework

**Input Variables:**
- Number of employees
- Estimated % who are caregivers (default: 43%)
- Average salary
- Current turnover rate
- Cost to replace employee (default: 50-200% of salary)

**Key Metrics:**

| Factor | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Workdays missed per caregiver/year | 6.6 | AARP 2025 |
| Productivity loss per caregiver | 18.5% | Various studies |
| Cost per absence day | $200-500 | Industry average |
| Absenteeism cost per caregiver/year | $2,110 | Calculated |
| Turnover risk for caregivers | 27% reduced hours, 16% quit | AARP 2025 |
| Cost to replace employee | 50-200% of salary | SHRM |
| ROI on caregiver benefits | 2-4.25x | Harvard/BPC |

**Sample Calculation (1,000 employees):**

```
Employees: 1,000
Caregivers (43%): 430
Annual absenteeism cost: 430 x $2,110 = $908,300

Norma cost ($6 PEPM x 12 months): $72,000/year

If Norma reduces absenteeism by 10%: $90,830 savings
If Norma prevents 2 caregiver departures: $100,000+ savings
Total potential savings: $190,000+

ROI: 264% ($190,000 / $72,000)
```

### 5.3 Norma vs. AI Robot (ElliQ)

| Dimension | ElliQ | Norma |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Form Factor** | Physical robot device | Software/app (no hardware) |
| **Price Point** | $600/year + $250 installation | $60-100/year (employer subsidized) |
| **Distribution** | Government partnerships, D2C | B2B2C through employers |
| **Setup** | In-home installation required | Remote setup possible |
| **Scalability** | Hardware logistics | Unlimited software deployment |

**Positioning:** "ElliQ requires hardware installation and costs $850 upfront. Norma delivers AI companionship through any device, subsidized by employers."

**Differentiation:** Focus on B2B2C distribution and lower friction deployment.

---

### 5.4 Norma vs. Human Companionship (Papa)

| Dimension | Papa | Norma |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Model** | Gig workers ("Pals") | AI companion |
| **Availability** | Scheduled hours (36-120/year) | 24/7 availability |
| **Scalability** | Labor-constrained | Unlimited |
| **Cost** | High (human labor) | Low (software) |
| **Consistency** | Different Pals each visit | Same "personality" always |

**Positioning:** "Papa provides periodic human visits. Norma provides consistent daily AI companionship. They complement each other."

**Integration Opportunity:** Papa for in-person visits, Norma for daily engagement between visits.

---

### 5.5 Integration vs. Standalone Positioning

**As Integration (Within Platforms):**
- Position as "Companion Technology Module"
- Emphasize platform enhancement, not competition
- Offer API, SSO, data sharing
- Revenue share or licensing model

**As Standalone (Direct to Employers):**
- Position as "AI Companion Benefit"
- Emphasize unique value: daily senior engagement
- Integration with existing platforms (Wellthy, Cariloop)
- Direct PEPM pricing

**Recommended Strategy:**
- **Phase 1:** Pursue integrations with platforms (faster scale, validation)
- **Phase 2:** Build direct sales for employers not using platforms
- **Phase 3:** Become platform-agnostic standard

## Part 7: Outreach Templates

### 7.1 Partnership Email to Cariloop/Homethrive

**Subject:** AI Companion Technology Partnership - Extending Your Caregiver Platform

---

Hi [Julie/Dave],

I've been following Cariloop's growth - congratulations on the Series C and the Grayce partnership. The consolidation in the caregiver benefits space signals how critical this market has become.

I'm reaching out because we've built something that I believe complements your platform beautifully.

**The Gap:** Care coordination platforms like Cariloop solve an enormous problem for working caregivers. But there's one thing Care Coaches can't provide: daily engagement with the senior they're caring for. Employees tell us their biggest source of stress isn't finding providers - it's wondering how their parent is doing day-to-day.

**Norma:** We've built an AI companion specifically for seniors that provides daily cognitive engagement and companionship. For the working caregiver (your member), it provides visibility into their parent's wellness - reducing anxiety and the urge to take unplanned time off to "check in."

**The Opportunity:** Integrate Norma as a "Companion Technology Module" within Cariloop, giving your enterprise clients something no competitor offers - not just care coordination, but care connection.

I'd love 20 minutes to show you how this could work and hear your thoughts. Would next Tuesday or Wednesday work?

Best,
[Name]
Norma - AI Companion for Seniors

P.S. Our beta shows 30+ daily interactions per senior and a 40% reduction in caregiver anxiety. Happy to share the data.

### 7.2 LinkedIn Message to HR Leaders

**Connection Request:**

Hi [Name], I lead partnerships at Norma, an AI companion for seniors. I saw that [Company] has invested in caregiver benefits - would love to connect and share what we're seeing in the market.

**Follow-Up After Connection:**

Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

I noticed [Company] is recognized for employee benefits innovation. Quick question: are you seeing increased demand from employees for support with aging parents?

We've been working with HR teams on a new category - AI companions that provide daily engagement with employees' aging parents and give caregivers visibility into their wellbeing.

The ROI data is compelling: caregivers miss 6.6 days/year, and solutions like this reduce that significantly.

If you're open to it, I'd love to share a 5-minute overview and get your perspective on whether this resonates with your workforce. No pitch - just exploring fit.

Let me know if you have 15 minutes in the next couple weeks.

**Norma Pilot Proposal for [Company]**

With [X,000] employees and an estimated 43% serving as caregivers, [Company] has approximately [Y] employees balancing work with caring for aging family members. Research shows these employees miss an average of 6.6 additional workdays per year and are 27% more likely to reduce hours or leave.

### 7.4 Cold Email to Benefits Consultant

**Subject:** New Benefit Category: AI Companions for Working Caregivers

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because Mercer/WTW is often the first call when employers want to evaluate innovative benefits.

There's a new category emerging: **AI companions for seniors**, designed specifically for the employer market. With 63M Americans now serving as caregivers (45% increase since 2015) and employers losing $33B annually in caregiver-related productivity loss, we're seeing significant interest.

**What's New:** Existing caregiver benefits (Wellthy, Cariloop) focus on care coordination for the employee. AI companions engage directly with the senior - providing daily cognitive engagement, companionship, and wellness visibility for the working caregiver.

**The Data:**
- 95% loneliness reduction in AI companion users (NYSOFA/ElliQ study)
- 366% ROI on caregiver benefits (Harvard Business School)
- Only 13% of employers offer caregiver benefits (massive growth runway)

I'd value 20 minutes of your time to share what we're building and get your perspective on how this fits into your clients' benefits strategies.

Would you be open to a brief call next week?

Best,
[Name]
Norma - AI Companion for Seniors
