## Part 7: Risks & Considerations

### Market Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Long enterprise sales cycles (6-18 months) | Start with mid-market employers; use GCM channel for immediate revenue |
| Platform partners could build competitive features | Move fast; build relationships; consider exclusivity |
| Senior tech adoption barriers | Focus on caregiver (adult child) as primary user; ensure senior UX is excellent |
| Privacy/HIPAA concerns | Ensure compliance; get legal review of all integrations |

### Competitive Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Employer platforms have incumbent vendors | Differentiate on AI companion (not just coordination) |
| Care.com/A Place for Mom have deep pockets | Partner rather than compete; be the AI layer |
| Other AI companions entering market | First-mover advantage; deep integrations create switching costs |

### Execution Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Integration complexity | Prioritize platforms with modern APIs; start simple |
| GCM adoption may be slow | Strong referral incentives; make it easy to recommend |
| Measuring ROI is hard | Build engagement metrics; partner with academic researchers |

### Regulatory Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| State regulations on senior care | Legal review in each state |
| Data privacy (CCPA, state laws) | Privacy-by-design; clear consent flows |
| Healthcare classification risk | Avoid medical claims; position as companionship/wellness |
