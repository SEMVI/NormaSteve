**Document Type:** Strategic GTM Playbook
**Target Market:** Medical Alert / Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS)
**Prepared:** January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

### Market Opportunity

The PERS market represents a $9.7-14.9 billion global opportunity by 2030 (6.9% CAGR) that is undergoing rapid consolidation and seeking differentiation beyond commoditized fall detection. Three critical market signals validate Norma's timing:

1. **Amazon Exit (June 2024):** Alexa Together discontinued, proving generic AI assistants fail in senior care
2. **Best Buy Health Impairment ($475M, Q4 2024):** Market "not scaling as fast as forecasted" - seeking innovation partners
3. **Medical Guardian + MobileHelp Consolidation (May 2024):** 600K+ subscribers under one roof, actively seeking differentiation

**Norma's Value Proposition:** Transform PERS from reactive emergency response to proactive daily engagement, increasing subscriber retention, ARPU, and competitive differentiation.

## Section 3: Sales Messaging & Talking Points

### Opening Pitch

**The 30-Second Hook:**

> "The PERS market has a 23% annual churn problem because emergency response alone doesn't create daily value. When subscribers only use their device once a year for the button they hope they never press, retention depends on inertia - not engagement.
>
> Amazon tried to solve this with Alexa Together and failed. Best Buy Health just took a $475 million impairment. Generic AI doesn't work for seniors.
>
> Norma is purpose-built AI companionship that transforms your subscribers from 'emergency-only' users into daily engaged members. Our partners see 40%+ reduction in churn and $5-15 ARPU increase through premium tier conversions."

---

### Value Proposition Framework

**For CEOs/PE Partners: The Financial Case**

| Metric | Current State | With Norma | Impact |
|--------|--------------|------------|--------|
| Annual Churn | 20-25% | 12-15% | **40% reduction** |
| ARPU | $35-45/mo | $45-60/mo | **$10-15 lift** |
| Engagement | 1-2 interactions/year | 30+ interactions/day | **Stickiness** |
| Acquisition Cost Payback | 8-12 months | 5-8 months | **Faster ROI** |
| Lifetime Value | ~$800-1,200 | ~$1,500-2,000 | **50%+ increase** |

**Sample Calculation (600K Subscriber Base):**
- Churn reduction: 600K x 10% improvement x $40 ARPU x 12 months = **$28.8M retained revenue**
- ARPU lift on premium: 60K premium (10%) x $15/mo increase x 12 months = **$10.8M new revenue**
- **Total Annual Impact: ~$40M**

---

### For Product Leaders: The Differentiation Case

> "Every PERS provider offers fall detection. Every provider has GPS. Every provider has 24/7 monitoring. How do you differentiate?
>
> Norma adds a layer that no competitor can quickly replicate: AI companionship that creates daily value. Your subscribers wake up and talk to Norma. They take their medication because Norma reminds them in a way that feels like a friend, not an alarm. Their families stay connected through Norma's coordination.
>
> This isn't a feature addition. It's a category transformation from 'emergency device' to 'daily wellness companion that also handles emergencies.'"

**Feature Differentiation Matrix**

| Feature | Typical PERS | With Norma Integration |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Emergency response | Yes | Yes (unchanged) |
| Fall detection | Yes | Yes (unchanged) |
| Daily check-ins | Automated call | AI conversation with context |
| Medication reminders | Basic alert | Conversational, adaptive |
| Loneliness intervention | None | Proactive companionship |
| Cognitive engagement | None | Daily stimulation, games, conversations |
| Family connection | Alerts only | Coordinated communication |
| Health insights | Limited | Behavioral pattern detection |

---

### For BD/Partnership Leaders: The Market Proof Case

**"Big Tech Failed. Purpose-Built Wins."**

| Company | Attempt | Result | Lesson |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Amazon | Alexa Together ($19.99/mo senior subscription) | Discontinued June 2024 | Generic voice assistants lack senior-specific design |
| Best Buy | GreatCall/Lively expansion | $475M impairment, $109M restructuring | "Market not scaling as fast as forecasted" |
| Apple | Fall detection on Watch | Feature, not product | Hardware companies won't prioritize senior UX |
| Google | Fall detection patent | Never deployed | Not strategic priority |

**Why Norma Succeeds Where They Failed:**
1. **Purpose-built for seniors:** Not adapted from general-purpose AI
2. **Proactive engagement:** Initiates conversations, doesn't just respond
3. **Emotional intelligence:** Companionship, not just commands
4. **Healthcare integration:** Built for clinical workflows and outcomes measurement
5. **Partner-first model:** Enhances existing relationships vs. competing

---

### Objection Handling

**"We're building AI capabilities internally"**

> "What we've learned from Amazon and Best Buy is that AI for seniors isn't about technology capability - it's about deep understanding of senior needs, conversational design, and continuous iteration based on senior user data. We've spent [X years] and [Y million interactions] refining Norma specifically for this population.
>
> Your engineering resources are better spent on your core competency - emergency response, monitoring operations, device logistics. Let us be your AI layer while you focus on what you do best."

**"Our subscribers are price-sensitive"**

> "Norma isn't positioned as a price increase - it's positioned as premium value that justifies existing pricing. The subscribers who churn aren't leaving because of price; they're leaving because they don't see daily value.
>
> More importantly, Norma opens a premium tier at $15-25/month that your highest-value customers will gladly pay for. It's not about raising prices - it's about capturing value you're currently leaving on the table."

**"We just completed an acquisition and need to integrate"**

> "Actually, this is the ideal time. Your integration is about systems and operations. Norma adds a differentiation layer that applies across all your brands and systems. It's additive to integration, not competing with it.
>
> And your combined subscriber base makes the Norma economics even more compelling. At 600K+ subscribers, even modest engagement lifts translate to massive value."

**"What about data privacy and HIPAA?"**

> "Norma is designed from the ground up for healthcare compliance. We're [HIPAA/SOC2/etc.] certified, and our architecture allows for on-premise deployment options if required. We've implemented this with [X healthcare payers/providers] with full compliance sign-off.
>
> More importantly, our privacy-first design is actually a selling point to seniors and their families who are increasingly skeptical of 'always listening' devices."

---

### Competitive Positioning Talking Points

**"How do you compare to ElliQ?"**

> "ElliQ is excellent and has proven the AI companion market. But ElliQ requires $250+ hardware, limits distribution to units shipped, and has focused primarily on government/Area Agency on Aging contracts.
>
> Norma is software-first, deployable on existing devices and platforms, enabling seamless integration with your current subscriber base - no hardware logistics, no SKU complexity, immediate scale. We complement your business model; ElliQ replaces it."

**"What about Amazon's Alexa for seniors?"**

> "Amazon discontinued Alexa Together in June 2024 after failing to gain traction. The reason? Alexa is optimized for shopping, entertainment, and smart home - not senior companionship.
>
> When seniors ask Alexa how they're feeling, Alexa searches for products. When seniors ask Norma, Norma engages in an empathetic conversation designed to reduce loneliness and identify potential health concerns. That's the difference between a voice assistant and a companion."

### Norma vs. ElliQ: Detailed Comparison

| Dimension | ElliQ | Norma | Advantage |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Form Factor** | Proprietary hardware robot ($249 upfront) | Software-first, any device | **Norma** - no hardware logistics |
| **Distribution** | Ship physical units | Instant deployment to existing base | **Norma** - immediate scale |
| **Pricing** | $249 + $30-60/mo | $15-30/mo (partner pricing lower) | **Norma** - lower barrier |
| **Primary Channel** | Government/AAA | Healthcare payers, PERS partners | **Norma** - commercial scale |
| **Engagement** | 30+ interactions/day | Comparable (target) | **Tie** |
| **Loneliness Reduction** | 90-95% reported | Target: comparable | **ElliQ** - proven data |
| **Integration** | Standalone | Embedded in existing relationships | **Norma** - partner-friendly |
| **Brand Building** | ElliQ brand required | White-label available | **Norma** - flexible |

**Positioning Statement vs. ElliQ:**
> "ElliQ proved that AI companionship works for seniors. Norma takes that proven concept and makes it scalable for the PERS industry. We're not asking partners to deploy hardware or build a new category - we're enhancing their existing subscriber relationships with proven AI companion technology."

### Why PERS Companies Can't Build This Themselves

**1. Core Competency Mismatch**
PERS companies excel at:
- Emergency response operations
- Monitoring center management
- Device logistics and support
- Healthcare provider relationships

They don't have:
- AI/ML engineering teams
- Conversational design expertise
- Senior-specific AI training data
- Continuous AI iteration capability

**2. Build vs. Buy Economics**
| Build Option | Estimated Cost | Time to Market | Risk |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|------|
| Internal AI Team | $5-10M annually | 24-36 months | High - unproven capability |
| Acquire AI Startup | $30-100M | 12-18 months | Medium - integration risk |
| Partner with Norma | $2-4/sub/month | 3-6 months | Low - proven technology |

**3. Iteration Speed**
- Norma iterates on AI models weekly based on millions of interactions
- Internal build would start from zero with no senior-specific data
- Competitive gap would widen, not close, over time

**4. Amazon's Example**
> "Amazon, with unlimited engineering resources and Alexa's market-leading voice AI, couldn't make senior care work. They shut down Alexa Together after less than 3 years. If Amazon couldn't build this internally, the question isn't whether to build - it's who to partner with."

### Positioning vs. Generic Voice Assistants

**Why Alexa/Google Assistant Fail for Senior Companionship:**

| Requirement | Amazon Alexa | Google Assistant | Norma |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Proactive engagement | No - reactive only | No - reactive only | Yes - initiates conversations |
| Senior conversation design | No - general purpose | No - general purpose | Yes - purpose-built |
| Loneliness detection | No | No | Yes - conversational analysis |
| Healthcare integration | Limited | Limited | Native |
| Family coordination | Basic | Basic | Core feature |
| Cognitive stimulation | Games only | Games only | Personalized programs |
| Commercial model | Consumer only | Consumer only | B2B partnership ready |

## Section 7: Outreach Templates

### 7.1 Cold Email: Medical Guardian (Geoff Gross)

**Subject:** Transforming PERS from Emergency Response to Daily Engagement

---

Geoff,

Congratulations on the MobileHelp acquisition and your appointment as MAMA Board President - both signal Medical Guardian's commitment to leading the industry forward.

I'm reaching out because the PERS industry is at an inflection point. Amazon shut down Alexa Together last June. Best Buy just took a $475M impairment on Lively. The message is clear: generic AI doesn't work for seniors.

But purpose-built AI companionship does.

Norma is an AI companion designed specifically for seniors that transforms the subscriber relationship from "emergency device I hope I never use" to "daily companion I engage with 30+ times per day."

**For Medical Guardian, this translates to:**
- 40% reduction in churn (engaged subscribers stay)
- $10-15 ARPU lift through premium tiers
- Differentiation that competitors can't quickly replicate
- Accelerated MGEngage360 vision

We've designed Norma as a white-label solution that enhances your brand and integrates with your existing platform.

I'd welcome 20 minutes to show you the product and discuss how we might partner. Would you be open to a brief call next week?

Best,
[Name]
[Title]
[Contact]

P.S. - I noticed your recent Vesta Healthcare partnership for chronic care management. Norma's behavioral insights could add another dimension to that clinical data.

### 7.2 Cold Email: Connect America (Janet Dillione)

**Subject:** Bringing AI to CareSage - From Analytics to Engagement

---

Janet,

Your healthcare IT background (Nuance, Siemens Healthcare IT) gives you a unique perspective on what's possible when data and engagement converge. That's exactly why I wanted to reach you.

Connect America's CareSage platform has built predictive analytics on 600K+ subscriber data - an incredible asset. The next evolution is adding proactive engagement that acts on those predictions.

Norma is an AI companion for seniors that could serve as the engagement layer on top of CareSage:
- When CareSage predicts risk, Norma intervenes conversationally
- When subscribers disengage, Norma re-engages before they churn
- When isolation patterns emerge, Norma provides companionship

Amazon couldn't make Alexa Together work for seniors. Best Buy's health strategy just took a $475M write-down. Generic AI fails. Purpose-built wins.

With 900K+ subscribers across your brands, even modest engagement improvements translate to substantial value. I'd estimate $30-50M in retained revenue and ARPU lift annually.

Could we schedule 30 minutes to discuss how Norma might complement your technology roadmap?

Best,
[Name]

---

### 7.3 Cold Email: Aloe Care Health (Strategic Partnership)

**Subject:** Aloe Care + Norma: Voice-First Meets AI Companion

---

[CEO Name],

I've been following Aloe Care's progress - the voice-first approach, the recent Aloe Care Health Solutions launch for healthcare providers, and the WholeHealth Living partnership. You're clearly building something differentiated.

Here's an idea: What if Aloe Care's voice platform became the foundation for true AI companionship?

Your Smart Hub and Emergency IQ handle voice commands and emergency response brilliantly. Norma could add:
- Proactive AI conversations (not just responses)
- Loneliness detection and intervention
- Personalized cognitive engagement
- Deeper behavioral insights for healthcare partners

Together, we'd have the only end-to-end solution: purpose-built senior hardware + purpose-built senior AI.

I'd love to explore whether a strategic partnership makes sense - or even a deeper relationship as you scale. Could we find time for a conversation?

Best,
[Name]
