# Norma PACE Programs GTM Playbook

## Executive Summary

PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) represents Norma's highest-conviction B2B opportunity. The capitated payment model creates direct financial alignment: PACE operators keep the savings when technology reduces hospitalizations, ER visits, and nursing home placements.

**Why PACE First:**
- 198 programs, 90K+ participants, record 25 new programs opened in 2024
- Capitated payments ($2,700-8,200 PMPM) = operators directly benefit from cost reduction
- High-acuity, socially isolated population = maximum impact for AI companion
- Faster sales cycles than Medicare Advantage (no June bid cycle)
- Evidence generated transfers directly to MA payer conversations

## 4. Sales Messaging & Talking Points

### Opening Pitch

> "PACE participants average 7+ chronic conditions and significant social isolation—the exact population where AI companionship has the highest impact. Unlike fee-for-service, your capitated model means every hospitalization prevented and every day of nursing home placement avoided goes directly to your bottom line. We'd like to discuss how Norma can help your participants stay healthier and more engaged at home."

### Value Proposition by Stakeholder

**For CEOs:**
- Differentiation in competitive PACE markets
- Improved quality scores and star ratings
- Participant satisfaction and retention
- Growth story for investors (InnovAge) or funders (nonprofits)

**For CMOs:**
- Early detection of health changes through daily engagement
- Medication adherence support
- Falls prevention through cognitive engagement
- Depression and loneliness intervention

**For COOs:**
- Extend care team reach without adding headcount
- Reduce after-hours call volume
- Streamline participant check-ins
- Data on participant wellbeing between center visits

**For Directors of Social Services:**
- 24/7 companionship for isolated participants
- Cognitive stimulation and engagement
- Family connection and communication
- Life enrichment programming support

### Key Statistics to Cite

| Stat | Source |
|------|--------|
| Social isolation increases mortality risk by 26% | National Academies of Sciences |
| Loneliness increases dementia risk by 50% | Journal of Neurology |
| PACE saves taxpayers $10,000/participant/year | WelbeHealth |
| ElliQ reduced loneliness by 95% in NY State pilot | Intuition Robotics |
| Isolated seniors have $1,608 higher annual costs | AARP/Harvard |

### Objection Handling

**"Our participants aren't tech-savvy."**
> "That's exactly why Norma is voice-first with no screens required. Our interface is designed for seniors with cognitive impairment, vision issues, and no prior tech experience. The NY State ElliQ pilot showed 95% loneliness reduction specifically with this population."

**"We're focused on opening new centers right now."**
> "New centers are the perfect opportunity—you can build Norma into your care model from day one rather than retrofitting. We can align our pilot with your next center opening."

**"How does this integrate with our EMR?"**
> "We integrate with [Epic/PointClickCare/etc.] to surface participant engagement data directly in your clinical workflows. Care teams get alerts on concerning patterns without logging into another system."

**"What's the evidence base?"**
> "We can share outcomes from [pilots/comparable deployments]. More importantly, we structure our contracts with outcomes guarantees—if we don't hit agreed metrics, you don't pay."

## 5. Partnership Models

### Model A: Fixed PMPM License

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Structure** | $25-40/participant/month |
| **Billing** | Monthly based on active census |
| **Includes** | Software, onboarding, support, integrations |
| **Minimum** | 50 participants |
| **Contract term** | 12-24 months |

**Best for**: Organizations wanting predictable costs

### Model B: Shared Savings

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Structure** | Base fee ($10-15 PMPM) + 20-30% of documented savings |
| **Savings measured** | Hospitalization reduction, ER visits, nursing home days |
| **Baseline** | Prior 12-month utilization |
| **True-up** | Quarterly reconciliation |

**Best for**: Organizations confident in Norma's impact, want aligned incentives

### Model C: Outcomes-Based Pilot

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Structure** | Reduced pilot rate with performance guarantees |
| **Pilot size** | 50-100 participants |
| **Duration** | 6 months |
| **Metrics** | Loneliness scores, engagement rates, hospitalization rates |
| **Success triggers** | Full rollout at standard rates |
| **Guarantee** | Money-back if metrics not achieved |

**Best for**: Risk-averse organizations, first PACE customers

### Recommended Approach

Start with **Model C (Outcomes-Based Pilot)** to land first customers, then convert to **Model A or B** for full rollout. This de-risks the decision for PACE operators while building the evidence base.

## 6. Pricing Strategy

### PMPM Pricing Framework

| Tier | Participants | PMPM Rate | Annual Value |
|------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Pilot | 50-100 | $20-25 | $12K-30K |
| Growth | 100-500 | $25-35 | $30K-210K |
| Scale | 500+ | $30-40 | $180K-480K+ |

### ROI Model for PACE Operators

**Assumptions:**
- Average PACE PMPM received: $5,000
- Annual hospitalization rate: 25% of participants
- Average hospitalization cost to PACE: $15,000
- Norma reduces hospitalizations by 15%

**Calculation (500 participants):**
- Baseline hospitalizations: 125/year × $15,000 = $1.875M
- With Norma (15% reduction): 106/year × $15,000 = $1.59M
- **Annual savings: $281,250**
- Norma cost: 500 × $35 × 12 = $210,000
- **Net ROI: $71,250 (34% return)**

*This excludes additional savings from ER reduction, nursing home diversion, and improved quality scores.*

## 8. Outreach Templates

### Email to WelbeHealth (Si France, CEO)

**Subject:** AI companion for WelbeHealth participants — physician-to-founder

Dr. France,

Your work scaling PACE through WelbeHealth caught my attention—especially the Coachella Valley launch as the first PACE center in a 70-mile radius. Bringing comprehensive care to underserved seniors is exactly what drew me to this space.

I'm building Norma, an AI companion designed specifically for the PACE population. Our participants average 7+ chronic conditions and significant social isolation—the exact profile where daily engagement has the highest clinical impact.

For WelbeHealth specifically, I see three opportunities:

1. **New center differentiation** — Launch with AI companionship as a core feature in your 2025 centers
2. **Care team leverage** — Extend your IDT's reach without proportional headcount growth
3. **Quality scores** — Improve participant satisfaction and engagement metrics

Given your background building GoHealth to 200+ locations, I'd value your perspective on scaling technology-enabled senior care.

Would you have 20 minutes this month to explore whether this fits WelbeHealth's roadmap?

[Signature]

### Email to InnovAge (Michael Scarbrough, President & COO)

**Subject:** Participant engagement at scale — from one Optum alum to another

Michael,

Congratulations on the InnovAge role. Your Optum at Home experience serving 800K D-SNP members is exactly what PACE needs as it scales nationally.

I'm building Norma, an AI companion for seniors that addresses the engagement gap between PACE center visits. For participants with 7+ chronic conditions living at home, daily AI interaction can catch early warning signs, reduce loneliness-driven utilization, and extend your care team's reach.

InnovAge's Q3 results show the turnaround is working—13% revenue growth and improving margins. I believe participant engagement technology could accelerate that trajectory while differentiating InnovAge in competitive markets like California.

Specifically, I'd like to discuss:
- Piloting with 50-100 participants at one Colorado or California center
- Measuring hospitalization reduction and participant satisfaction
- Outcomes-based pricing that aligns our incentives

Would you have time for a call in the next two weeks?

[Signature]
