# Norma Chronic Care Management (CCM) GTM Playbook

## Executive Summary

Chronic Care Management represents Norma's **fastest path to revenue** with the clearest reimbursement structure. Medicare pays physicians $60-82/patient/month for CCM services, but most practices struggle to deliver profitably due to patient engagement challenges. Norma can serve as the "always-on" patient engagement layer that enables higher-quality CCM delivery.

**Why CCM First:**
- Clear Medicare reimbursement (CPT 99490, 99491, 99439)
- 40M+ eligible patients with 2+ chronic conditions
- Existing CCM vendors actively seeking engagement technology
- 3-6 month path to revenue through B2B partnerships
- CMS increasing reimbursement 10%+ in 2026

---

## 1. Market Overview

### What is Chronic Care Management?

CCM is a Medicare program that reimburses providers for non-face-to-face care coordination for patients with 2+ chronic conditions. Services include:
- Monthly check-in calls
- Medication management
- Care plan development and updates
- Coordination between specialists
- 24/7 access to care team

### Patient Eligibility
- 2+ chronic conditions expected to last 12+ months
- Conditions place patient at significant risk of death, acute exacerbation, or functional decline
- Must provide written consent
- Office visit within past 12 months

### 2025 Medicare Reimbursement Rates

| CPT Code | Description | Time Required | 2025 Rate | 2026 Rate |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| **99490** | CCM base code | First 20 min/month | $60.49 | $66.30 (+10%) |
| **99439** | CCM add-on | Each additional 20 min | $45.93 | $50.56 (+10%) |
| **99491** | Complex CCM | First 30 min (physician-led) | $82.16 | ~$90 |
| **99487** | Complex CCM | First 60 min | ~$130 | ~$143 |
| **G0511** | RHC/FQHC CCM | Per month | $72.98 | Discontinued July 2025 |

**Key Change for 2025:** Rural Health Clinics and FQHCs can now bill standard CCM codes (99490, etc.) instead of G0511, opening a larger market.

### Market Size

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Medicare beneficiaries with 2+ chronic conditions | 40M+ |
| Current CCM enrollment rate | <10% of eligible |
| CCM software market size | $5.7B |
| Average revenue per CCM patient | $60-130/month |
| Average savings per CCM patient | $4,000/year (ChartSpan data) |

### The Engagement Problem

CCM programs struggle because:
1. **Patients don't answer calls** — 30-40% of scheduled calls go unanswered
2. **20 minutes is hard to fill** — Care managers struggle to have meaningful conversations
3. **Between-call gaps** — No touchpoints between monthly calls
4. **Documentation burden** — Staff spend time documenting, not engaging
5. **Enrollment friction** — Patients don't understand or value the program

**Norma's Opportunity:** AI companion provides daily engagement, surfaces issues for care managers, and makes monthly calls more productive.

---

## 4. Sales Messaging & Talking Points

### Opening Pitch

> "CCM programs have an engagement problem. Care managers spend 30-40% of their time on calls that don't connect, and patients forget about CCM between monthly touchpoints. Norma is an AI companion that engages patients daily, surfaces health concerns to care managers, and makes that 20-minute monthly call dramatically more productive. We're not replacing your care managers—we're making them 3x more effective."

### Value Proposition by Stakeholder

**For CCM Vendor CEOs:**
- Differentiation in crowded market
- Higher patient retention (reduce churn)
- Upsell opportunity (AI tier)
- Improved outcomes for case studies

**For CCM Vendor Product Leaders:**
- AI capability without building from scratch
- Faster time-to-market than internal development
- White-label flexibility

**For CCM Vendor Clinical Leaders:**
- Proactive issue detection
- Better documentation of patient status
- Earlier intervention on declining patients
- Reduced care manager burnout

**For Practice Administrators:**
- Higher CCM enrollment rates
- More billable time captured
- Better patient satisfaction scores

### ROI Calculation

**Scenario: CCM vendor with 10,000 enrolled patients**

| Metric | Without Norma | With Norma | Impact |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Monthly call connection rate | 65% | 85% | +20% |
| Average billable time/patient | 22 min | 35 min | +59% |
| Patient monthly churn | 5% | 3% | -40% |
| Revenue per patient (blended) | $65 | $85 | +$20 |

**Annual Impact:**
- Additional revenue: 10,000 × $20 × 12 = **$2.4M/year**
- Reduced churn value: 2% × 10,000 × $65 × 12 = **$156K saved**
- **Total value: ~$2.5M/year**

### Key Statistics to Cite

| Stat | Source |
|------|--------|
| CCM reduces hospitalizations by 23% | CMS |
| Average CCM patient saves $4,000/year | ChartSpan |
| Only ~10% of eligible patients enrolled in CCM | Industry estimates |
| 2026 CCM reimbursement increasing 10%+ | CMS Final Rule |
| Social isolation increases healthcare costs $1,608/year | AARP/Harvard |

### Objection Handling

**"We already have a patient engagement solution."**
> "Most engagement solutions are portals or apps that require patients to take action. Norma is proactive—it reaches out to patients, has conversations, and reports back. It's the difference between a gym membership and a personal trainer."

**"Our patients are too old for AI."**
> "Norma is voice-first, designed specifically for seniors with no tech experience. The NY State ElliQ deployment showed 95% loneliness reduction with an average age of 80+. Our interface is simpler than a phone call."

**"How does this integrate with our platform?"**
> "We provide a simple API that pushes daily engagement summaries, flags, and alerts into your existing care manager workflow. No new interface for your team to learn—Norma data shows up where they already work."

**"What about HIPAA?"**
> "Norma is fully HIPAA-compliant with BAA execution. We've designed for healthcare from day one, not retrofitted a consumer product."

**"We're focused on RPM right now, not engagement."**
> "Norma complements RPM perfectly. RPM gives you vitals data; Norma gives you context. When blood pressure spikes, Norma can tell you if the patient mentioned stress, missed medications, or had a sleepless night."

## 8. Outreach Templates

### Email to HealthSnap (Samson Magid, CEO)

**Subject:** AI patient engagement for HealthSnap's 100K+ patients

Samson,

Congrats on the Series B and the 2024 Clinical Outcomes Report—proving impact at 100K+ patients is no small feat.

I noticed your roadmap includes AI-powered population health analytics. I'm building the patient-facing complement: an AI companion that engages your CCM patients daily between care manager calls.

For HealthSnap specifically, I see three opportunities:

1. **Higher billable time** — Daily AI engagement surfaces topics for monthly calls, increasing average time from 22 to 35+ minutes
2. **Better retention** — Patients who engage daily churn 40% less
3. **Differentiation** — First CCM platform with proactive AI companion

We're designed for seniors with no tech experience—voice-first, simpler than a phone call. The NY State ElliQ deployment showed 95% loneliness reduction with average age 80+.

Would you have 20 minutes to explore whether this fits HealthSnap's product roadmap?

### Email to ChartSpan (Jon-Michial Carter, CEO)

**Subject:** Scaling ChartSpan's care managers with AI

Jon-Michial,

ChartSpan's $4,000/patient savings data is compelling—it's the kind of proof point that moves healthcare forward.

I'm building Norma, an AI companion that could help ChartSpan's care managers be 3x more effective. Here's the challenge I think you face: even great care managers can only make so many calls, and 30-40% of those calls don't connect.

Norma engages patients daily via voice conversation, then surfaces insights for your care managers:
- "Mrs. Johnson mentioned knee pain three times this week"
- "Mr. Smith hasn't been sleeping well since his wife's hospitalization"
- "Mrs. Garcia asked about her medication refill twice"

Your care managers start each call with context instead of small talk. Billable time goes up. Patient satisfaction goes up. Churn goes down.

As you expand nationally from the Southeast, AI-powered engagement could be the differentiator. Worth a conversation?

[Signature]

### Email to TimeDoc (Brian Esterly, CEO)

**Subject:** Congrats on TIME recognition — AI engagement opportunity

Brian,

Congrats on the TIME World's Top HealthTech Companies recognition. Building a category leader in CCM is hard work.

I noticed TimeDoc offers "staff augmentation" with care managers. I'm building the AI equivalent—a companion that engages patients daily between human touchpoints, making your care managers more effective without adding headcount.

Given your BHI (Behavioral Health Integration) focus, you likely see the connection between loneliness, depression, and chronic disease outcomes. Norma directly addresses this—NY State's ElliQ deployment showed 95% loneliness reduction.

For TimeDoc's enterprise health system customers, this could be the AI story that wins competitive deals.

Would you have time for a call this month?
