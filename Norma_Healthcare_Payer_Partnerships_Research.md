## Category A - Deep Business Strategy Analysis

**Date:** January 2026 (Updated)
**Prepared for:** Norma Leadership Team

---

## Executive Summary

The healthcare payer landscape presents a significant opportunity for Norma to establish partnerships that can drive both revenue growth and meaningful impact for seniors. This research examines three key partnership channels: Medicare Advantage plans, PACE programs, and the Veterans Affairs healthcare system.

### Key Findings

| Channel | Market Size | Strategic Fit | Timeline to Revenue | Recommended Priority |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Medicare Advantage** | 33M+ enrollees, $462B federal spending | High - aligns with SSBCI and loneliness initiatives | 12-24 months | **#1 - Primary Focus** |
| **PACE Programs** | 90,500+ participants, 198 programs | Very High - capitated model creates strong ROI incentive | 6-12 months | **#2 - Quick Win** |
| **VA System** | 8M+ veterans 65+, 2.1M telehealth users | Medium-High - complex procurement but large scale | 18-36 months | **#3 - Long-term Play** |

### The Opportunity

Social isolation costs Medicare an additional **$6.7 billion annually**, with isolated seniors incurring **$1,608 more per year** in healthcare costs. AI companion interventions have demonstrated a **95% reduction in loneliness** (NYSOFA/ElliQ pilot), creating a compelling value proposition for payers focused on total cost of care.

### 1.3 Supplemental Benefit Trends

#### 2024-2025 Market Shifts
For the first time in recent MA history, supplemental benefits are **declining** in prevalence.

| Benefit Category | 2024 | 2025 | Change |
|-----------------|------|------|--------|
| Vision/Dental/Hearing | 97%+ | 97%+ | Stable |
| Fitness Benefits | 95% | 95% | Stable |
| OTC Medication | 85% | 73% | **-12 pts** |
| **Remote Access Technologies** | **74%** | **53%** | **-21 pts** |
| Meal Benefits | 72% | 65% | **-7 pts** |
| Transportation | 36% | 30% | -6 pts |
| Caregiver Support (SNPs) | 5% | 5% | Stable |
| Telemonitoring (SNPs) | 2% | 2% | Stable |

#### Industry Commentary
- CVS Health CFO: "Supplemental benefits have to be on that list [of cuts]. Ourselves – and probably all the industry – are going to have to look at all the benefits across the board and decide where it is that we want to cut."
- Plans are rationalizing toward **evidence-based, outcomes-driven benefits**
- Growing focus on **social determinants of health (SDOH)**
- Increased interest in **loneliness and social isolation interventions** with demonstrated ROI

#### Social Isolation as SDOH Target
- Aetna launched **Social Isolation Index** to identify at-risk members
- Humana CMO: "Social isolation is a really important one for us" with "compelling evidence and data demonstrating strong relationships between social isolation and health outcomes"
- Humana is "uniquely positioned" to identify people who struggle with loneliness
- CMS increasingly supportive of SDOH-focused supplemental benefits

### 2.4 The Capitated Model: Why PACE Creates Strong Incentives

#### Payment Structure
PACE receives combined capitation from four sources:

**1. Medicare Parts A & B**
- Based on county benchmark (similar to MA)
- Risk-adjusted using CMS-HCC scores
- Additional **frailty adjustment** reflecting functional impairment
- Payment is **fixed for benefit period** regardless of health changes

**2. Medicare Part D**
- Prescription drug coverage capitation

**3. Medicaid Component**
- State-specific methodology
- Based on Upper Payment Limit (UPL) or Amount Otherwise Paid (AWOP)
- Must be less than nursing home cost equivalent
- Each state has different rate-setting approach

**4. Private Pay**
- For participants not eligible for Medicaid

#### PMPM Payment Examples (State Variation)
| Market | Full Dual PMPM | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| San Francisco, CA | $8,279 | Highest observed |
| Oklahoma | $2,737 | Lowest observed |
| **Typical range** | $4,000-6,000 | Varies by state/county |

#### Economic Incentive for Prevention
Because PACE is at **full financial risk**:
- Every avoided hospitalization = **direct savings to PACE organization**
- Every prevented nursing home placement = **significant cost avoidance**
- Investments in preventive technology have **clear ROI calculation**
- No fee-for-service incentive to increase utilization
- PACE has shown to help participants **live at home an extra 4 years on average**

#### Documented Outcomes
- **Fewer hospitalizations** than other care models
- **Better patient satisfaction** than D-SNPs
- **Higher quality of life** for participants
- Cost-efficient compared to comparable nursing facility care

| CMS tightens SSBCI evidence requirements | Build robust outcomes evidence from pilots |
| Plan consolidation/market exits | Diversify across multiple plan partners |
| AI regulation uncertainty | Ensure human oversight in all interactions |
| Star rating pressures | Demonstrate member satisfaction impact |

### PACE Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Small market size (90,500) | Use as proof point for MA strategy |
| For-profit operator financial struggles | Target well-capitalized organizations |
| Regulatory complexity | Partner with experienced PACE vendors |
| Geographic concentration | Expand as PACE grows to new states |

### VA Risks
